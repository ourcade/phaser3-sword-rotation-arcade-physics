## Watch on YouTube

You can watch how this example was created here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akgFNu60Kv4

Some code clean-up was added after the video ended that shows how it can work in both scenarios of having the circle physics body as part of the Container or as part of the Scene.

You can toggle the different cases in `SwordContainer.ts` by changing `containPhysicsObject`.

## Motivation

This is a potential solution to a problem discussed on the Phaser Discourse: https://phaser.discourse.group/t/workaround-for-rotation-on-arcade-physics/5763/6
